    "## What is Heap Sort?\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap sort is a sorting algorithm based on the binary heap data structure. Sorting is a process of arranging entities in a particular order, i.e. ascending, descending, or alphabetical order. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data structure sorting is concerned with the arrangement of data. There are different sorting algorithms that depend on various factors like data structure, complexity, etc. One of the popular sorting algorithms that we are going to discuss here is the Heap Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fully understand how heap sort works, we first have to understand a **binary heap** and subsequently, a **binary tree**.\n",

    "A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent. Every node in a binary tree has a left and right reference along with the data element. The node at the top of the hierarchy of a tree is called the root node. The nodes that hold other sub-nodes are the parent nodes.\n"

    "- **Parent Node** − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.\n",
    "- **Child Node** − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.\n",
