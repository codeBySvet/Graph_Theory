# Introduction

This repository is the third year project submission 
for the module "Graph Theory" in the Software Development 
course in ATU College. Graph theory is the study of graphs, 
which are mathematical structures used to model relationships 
between elements(objects). A graph consiste of one or more vertices which are connected by edges.

The aim of this repository is to 
investigate and discuss graph theory by taking a deep dive 
into two aspects. The Heap sort sorting 
algorithem and the Graph Isomorphism problem.




# Topics

### Heap sort
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithem used on 
Binary Heap data structure. Heapsort works by seperating its 
input into a sorted region and an unsorted region. It 
continuously moves elements from the unsorted region 
(by extracting the largest element from it) and inserting 
it into the sorted region until all elements are sorted.

I discuss Heap Sort in the context of:
* Explanation of the Heap Sort algorithm.
* Python function implementing Heap Sort.
* Explanation of the computational complexity of Heap Sort.
* Explanation of how graph theory is used in Heap Sort.

### Graph Isomorphism
Graph Isomorphism refers to the relationship between two graphs,
or to be exact, if those two graphs are equal (isomorphic) to 
one another. Two graphs which contain the same number of 
edges and vertices, connected in the same way, are said to be 
isomorphic. Even if they dont appear to be the same at first 
glance.

I discuss Graph Isomorphism in the context of:
* Explanation of the Graph Iomorphism Problem.
* Explanation of how graphs can be represented in data structures.
* Python function implementing an algorithm to determine if two graphs are isomorphic or not.
* Discussion of the computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
# Tech Stack

**Code language:** Python

**Platform:** Jupyter Notebook

# Installation

This project can be viewed directly through Github, or can be
viewed locally. If you wish to do so locally, you will need
to first install Jupyter Notebook and Python on your device:


I recommend using the Anaconda distribution to install 
Python and Jupyter Notebook. 



```bash
1. Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution. 
   I recommend downloading Anacondaâ€™s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.7).

```
```bash
2. Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions 
   on the download page.
   
   (Installing Anaconda automatically installs Python and Jupyter Notebook)

```

# Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/codeBySvet/Graph_Theory
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Graph_Theory
```

Start the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
  Jupyter Notebook
```
